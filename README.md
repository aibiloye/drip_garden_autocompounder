# drip_garden_autocompounder
This is meant to help make farming in the drip garden easier! 

This program is written in python, so you will need to download python.

Once python is downloaded, you will need to install pyautogui and open-cv (this is used for confidence for the images)
  - In a terminal type in:
  -   pip install opencv-python
  -   pip install pyautogui 
  -   pip install Pillow


This program relies on image recognition, and the images will be specific to your computer due to resolution.
  - Make sure you name the images the same as the attached images, but you will need to replicate the images as image recognition is specific to your computer
  - You must also realize that if you have the browser opened in full screen, and generate the images (using snipping tool), and minimize the browser, it will likely not 
   detect the images - so take the images in the configuration you will be likely to leave your computer in.
   
You will also need to disable the screen saver because the program will not be able to run when the screensaver is on.
